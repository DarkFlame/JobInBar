	<description>Puts a colonist's job in the Colonist Bar below their label
    
    Note that this is my first mod ever and the first version of it, don't be surprised if something breaks or performance is negatively impacted. Let me know, though and I'll see if I can fix it.
    The main shortcoming of this mod is that it does not use the label caching system that the colonist bar usually does, so with a large number of colonists it may lower performance. I don't really know enough about these things to say.</description>
